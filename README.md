# What is this repo

a collection of all the tools and resources I've used to learn and work with vscode developing
in an effort to automate the process of creating a repository with these tools included and to
document them for future reference.  This is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn
more descriptions are added in each file as comments but may be added here in future
